 > It does not really make sense for you to edit this document much (if at all) while working on the project - Instead, at the end of the planning phase, you can refer back to this document and decide which parts of your plan you are happy with and which parts you would like to change.


## Iteration XX

 * Start date: September 28, 2017
 * End date: October 10, 2017

## Process

(Optional:) Quick introduction

#### Roles & responsibilities

Describe the different roles on the team and the responsibilities associated with each role.

James Leja - Team leader: supervise the general process, communicate between the team and TA
Madumitha Ravichandran -
Anujan Murugesu -
Gabriel Chan -
Alexander Chong

Runhao Liang - Arrange meeting, manage the WhatsApp group

#### Events

There will be meetings every Thursday 13:00 - 14:00 at the Sidney Smith lounge to discuss the previous week's progress and decide what went as planned and what did not.

In the first half of a meeting, group members will share what she/he has done in the last week, what problems he/she meets. For the activities that did not go as planned discuss what went wrong and how it can be overcome and achieved the following week.

In the senond half, based on the previous week's progress, come up with a consensus on what the plan for the next iteration will be and assign roles accordingly. Also, discuss what potential problems there might be.

Other than the weekly meeting, group members update each other through a whatsapp group to clarify team goals, resolve any problems that may arise while working on his/her role and communicate information about meetings (such as a synopsis of the meeting for members who could not attend and reminders for future meetings). If any member can not show up in the next meeting, she/he need to inform everyone in the WhatsApp Group at least 24 hours in advance.

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to organize your team.   

- To do lists:
      list of tasks that must be completed in a given iteration, ordered by priority from highest to lowest.

 * Artifacts can be To-do lists, Task boards, schedule(s), etc.
 * We want to understand:
   * How do you keep track of what needs to get done?
   * How do you prioritize tasks?
   * How do tasks get assigned to team members?


## Product

#### Goals and tasks

 * Describe your goals for this iteration and the tasks that you will have to complete in order to achieve these goals.
 * Order the items from most to least important.
 * Feel free (but not obligated) to specify some/all tasks as user stories.

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to present your project idea.

 * Artifacts can be text, code, images, videos, interactive mock-ups and/or any other useful artifact you can think of.
 * Make sure to explain the purpose of each artifact (i.e. Why is it on your to-do list? Why is it useful for your team?)
 * Be concise, yet precise.         
   For example: "Build the website" is not precise at all, but "Build a static home page and upload it somewhere, so that it is publicly accessible" is much clearer.
